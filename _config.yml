about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm a passionate algorithm developer and data scientist with a keen interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems. With a background in systems engineering, I bring a unique perspective to the intersection of data science, applied machine learning, RAG and data-driven analysis and modeling. My projects reflect my commitment to innovative approaches in optimizing processes through the power of LLMs and data-driven insights.

  #I like: <mark>RAG</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          Quickly create surveys about which contentet is preferred using personas and LLMs.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project demonstates fast and extensive comparison and evaluation possibilities of two sets of content items <mark>A</mark> and <mark>B</mark> by A/B testing means using generated personas in combination with large language models (LLMs). For demonstration purposes, job descriptions are used. Fittingly, as for personas, gratuates of different fields of study are created.
          
          Of course, the scope of such comparisons is not limited to job descriptions. With slight modifications, images such as landing sites and design choices can be compared quite easily and extensively, e.g. using GPT Vision.

          Visualize and analyze your own paragliding flights.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This R script is developed to analyze and visualize paragliding flight data, e.g. from Skytraxx variometer records. It processes data sets including altitude, longitude, and latitude, offering useful analytics to understand paragliding patterns and behaviors.
